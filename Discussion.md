# Efficient Log Retrieval Approaches

## 1. **Stream Processing with Line-by-Line Filtering**  
**Intuition:** Reads the file line by line, checks if it starts with the target date, and writes matching entries to an output file.  
**Advantages:**   Low memory usage, simple, and cross-platform.  
**Best Use Case:** Efficient log extraction from large files when logs are evenly distributed.

## 2. **Binary Search on Sorted Logs**  
**Intuition:** Use binary search to quickly locate the start of the target dateâ€™s logs and read sequentially.  
**Advantages:**   Faster than linear scans for sorted logs.  
**Best Use Case:** When logs are pre-sorted by date & length of logs is known.

## 3. **Chunk-Based Parallel Processing**  
**Intuition:** Splits the file into chunks and processes them concurrently.  
**Advantages:**  Utilizes multi-core CPUs for faster processing.  
**Best Use Case:** When dealing with very large files and concurrent operations.

## 4. **Log Indexing System (Pre-Processing)**  
**Intuition:** Creates an index mapping dates to file positions for fast retrieval.  
**Advantages:**   Reduces read time for frequent queries.  
**Best Use Case:** When preprocessing is acceptable.

## **Approach Used: Chunk-Based Parallel Processing**

### **Technology Used**
- **Node.js** for file processing and parallelization.

### **Log File Location**
- The log file (`logs_2024.log`) should be located in the `/src` directory.

### **Why This Approach?**
- Optimizes performance for large files by leveraging multi-core systems.
- Processes chunks concurrently, significantly speeding up extraction.
- Suitable for environments with sufficient resources to handle parallel operations.

### **How It Works**
1. Splits the file into chunks of manageable size.
2. Each chunk is processed in parallel using worker threads or processes.
3. After processing, results are combined into a single output file.

### **Advantages**
- **Parallelism:** Utilizes multiple CPU cores for faster processing.
- **Efficient Resource Usage:** Breaks the task into smaller chunks, allowing concurrent execution.

### **Best Use Case**
- When files are extremely large and need fast processing.  
- When the system has multi-core CPUs and can handle parallel processing efficiently.

### **Limitations**
- **Higher Memory Usage:** Parallel processing requires more memory to manage multiple chunks.
- **Increased Complexity:** Requires careful management of threads and synchronization.
